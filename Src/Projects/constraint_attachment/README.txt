	Constraint Surface Attachment for Autodesk MotionBuilder

TODO:

 + 1) snap suggest raises too many times, even during source model manipulations
 + 2) keep constrained moving like inside parent constraint, in which coordinates we chould hold contact point, maybe local mesh coords ?!

 + 3) Use TBN for extracting rotation matrix instead of converting normal to rotation

 - 4) dynamic closest point casting

LOG
 06.10.18
  Updated and included into OpenMoBu

 15.12.15
 Fix attachment rotation issue by using TBN matrix

 13.12.15
 First workable version

 26.11.15
 Added barycentric coordinates to hold specified surface area, use normal then to compute new constrained rotation
