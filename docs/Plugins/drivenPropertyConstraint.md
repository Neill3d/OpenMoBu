# Driven Property Constraint

The main usage is to transfer value of some non animatable property into an animatable property. 
For example, to control a scale of a box by curve path length.

### How To Use

* Add a Driven Property constraint into the scene
* Put an object that you want to read property value from into a Source group
* Put an object that you want to transfer value into a Constrain group
* Switch to Setup tab in the Constraint UI Layout
* Drag and drop the source object once again but this time into a first container
* Drag and drop the constrain object into a second container
* Choose a property for the source and destination. An example is shown on the picture
* Activate the constraint and the value from the source object's property will be written into the destination object's property
