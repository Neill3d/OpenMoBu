# Driven Property Constraint

The main use of this constraint is to transfer the value of a non-animatable property to an animatable property. For example, controlling the scale of a box based on the length of a curve path.

### How To Use:

* Add a Driven Property constraint to the scene.
* Add the object from which you want to read the property value into the Source group.
* Add the object to which you want to transfer the value into the Constrain group.
* Switch to the Setup tab in the Constraint UI Layout.
* Drag and drop the source object again, but this time into the first container.
* Drag and drop the constrain object into the second container.
* Select the property for both the source and the destination. An example is shown in the picture.
* Activate the constraint, and the value from the source object's property will be transferred to the destination object's property.
