# Twist Extraction Constraint

A constraint that extracts rotation along a given local axis from a full 3-dimensional rotation.&#x20;

This technique is commonly used for roll joints in HumanIK setups, where the rotations along the local axis of arms, hands, and legs are distributed across roll joints to improve the quality of skinned meshes.
