	AutoSave manager plugin for Autodesk MotionBuilder 2009

 In this plugin I have implemented three features: 
1) Auto save animation of current character to a specified folder
2) Adding a submenu to the MoBu main menu using win api hook
3) Key shortcuts for the FCurves window (changing keyframe tangents)
