	View Two Panes with Barrel Distortion

 This is an example on how to apply distortion shader on top of rendered scene. Could be a starter point for VR experiments.

Big thanks to Christian Pötzsch
 and his great article https://www.imgtec.com/blog/speeding-up-gpu-barrel-distortion-correction-in-mobile-vr/

In that sample I'm showing several useful technique:
1) how to switch tool window into a fullscreen mode by using Qt (you should define USE_QT preprocessor)
2) how to use FBRenderer class to render scene from a custom camera and options
3) how to get number of current panes and cameras for each one
